## About Project (HackLab)

HackLab is a web-based computer simulation inspired by the book _Nand to Tetris_. It serves as an interactive laboratory for learning how computers are built, starting from simple NAND gates all the way to a full machine capable of running high-level programs.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical visualization**: explore the structure from NAND gates, flip-flops, registers, ALU, CPU, RAM, up to the complete Hack computer.
- **Exploration mode**: click on any block to reveal its implementation, either in HDL (Hardware Description Language) or basic logic composition.
- **Interactive simulation**: design or replicate components, run them, and verify against specifications.
- **Hack language support**: load and execute programs written in Hack assembly, and run higher-level Jack code.
- **Educational focus**: bridges theoretical computer science with hands-on practice, showing the full path from _bit_ to _computer_.
